        <p>I offer consultancy services in Quantum Information & Computation, and mathematics more generally. I consulted for <a href="https://www.phasecraft.io">Phasecraft</a>, a UK quantum computing company, for over two years. I have also done some freelance work with <a href="https://outlier.ai">Outlier</a>, training large language models to perform high-level mathematics. You can find my KolabTree profile <a href="https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/benjamin-j.71499">here</a>, or feel free to reach out to me directly.
        </p>
        

        <p>I also have extensive teaching and tutoring experience, including over 3 years ( ~250 hours) of tutoring A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics. I have marked homework sheets for several modules at university level, and co-lectured a course on Quantum Information to PhD students. I have worked as a teaching assistant in mathematics at a school in Mallorca, Spain, and have also given music lessons in guitar, piano, and drums to children.


            You can see my tutoring page <a href="https://www.firsttutors.com/uk/tutor/benjamin.maths.30/">here</a>, or again feel free to reach out directly via the email at the top of the page :)
